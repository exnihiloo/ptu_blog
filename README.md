# Final project for Code Academy.

The website is for blog creators, people can register to the website to write their own blog posts.
Also each blog can be liked and commented but only if user is registered.
Users also have their "read later list" if they are out of time they can mark each blog to reat later and find
the list of read laters on their profile.
